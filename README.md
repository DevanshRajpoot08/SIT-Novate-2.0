# SIT-Novate-2.0
🚀 Overview

Traditional IVR systems are outdated, robotic, and frustrating. Customers are forced to navigate “Press 1, Press 2” menus, leading to poor experiences, high call drop rates, and lost sales.

This project aims to build a Truly Intelligent, Human-Like, Multilingual AI Voice Chatbot that enables real-time, contextual, and emotionally aware voice conversations, especially optimized for countries like India where voice communication is preferred over typing.

🎯 Problem Statement

Despite the growth of AI chatbots in websites and messaging platforms, businesses struggle with:

❌ Robotic, menu-driven IVR systems

❌ Poor natural language understanding

❌ Lack of regional language support

❌ No emotional or contextual awareness

❌ High operational costs

❌ Customer frustration & call drop rates

❌ Loss of potential leads and sales

There is a strong need for a 24/7 autonomous AI voice assistant that understands real speech and behaves like a human support agent.

💡 Proposed Solution

We propose a Real-Time AI Voice Chatbot that:

🎤 Understands natural speech in regional languages

🧠 Uses NLP & LLMs for contextual understanding

❤️ Detects emotion, urgency, and sentiment

🔐 Identifies potential fraud patterns

🔄 Integrates with CRM, ERP, WhatsApp & Websites

🌍 Supports multilingual conversations

⏰ Operates 24/7 without human intervention
